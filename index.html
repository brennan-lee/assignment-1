          and Network Algorithms in 1983, Tarjan earned a bachelor’s degree in
          1969 for mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and
          then got master’s degree in 1971, doctorate in 1972 in computer

          Zawacki, Lily Maxine. Robert's quote is "Once you succeed in writing
          the programs for [these] complicated algorithms, they usually run
          extremely fast. The computer doesn't need to understand the algorithm,
          its task is only to run the programs". (Robert Tarjan)
